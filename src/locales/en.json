This procedure boasts excellent results across various demographics, including diabetic and senior patients, without the need for general anesthesia and with no age restrictions. The all-on-4 protocol efficiently addresses bone atrophy concerns by installing upper and lower fixed permanent jaws tailored to individual impressions. The complete recovery of the dental arch typically takes between 1 to 7 days, depending on factors such as the quick resolution of soft tissue swelling. Unlike removable dentures, the all-on-4 method offers ease of use, minimizing discomfort and avoiding potential issues like the destruction of remaining teeth or the development of periodontal diseases associated with prolonged use of full dentures.

    "blog_main_dentist_first_p":"The visit to the dentist causes fear in most of them and is treated as “necessary evil”. In order to avoid sharing the same phobias from our childhood with our kids, it is important to “make acquaintance” with the oral hygiene and the dentist from an early age. Since its infancy, even before the appearance of the first teeth, we are supposed to clean the baby’s gums after eating with a special toothbrush. It is important is to announce this tusk with enthusiasm “Now you’re going to brush our teeth!!!” in order our child will finally embrace this good habit. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends that children should pay their first visit to the doctor at the age of one year’s old. The dentist should be specialized in dental treatment of children and adolescents, so that you can be sure that your child will feel comfortable and familiar with the clinic. In the first visit your child will be checked for traces of teeth caries. Although children’s first teeth will soon be replaced by the permanent ones, they must stay healthy until that time, in order to reserve a healthy space for the eruption of permanent teeth that grow underneath. At the age of 5-6 year’s old, the child’s dentition begins to get replaced, and that is when the dentist will determine the need for referral to an orthodontist to prevent future problems. Therefore do not neglect your child’s appointment with the dentist.",

Therefore there is no risk of infection, allergy or other reactions. The PRP method rebuilds the skin naturally and eliminates wrinkles not by “filling” them with foreign substances in the body, but refreshing the skin from within: collagen and hyaluronic acid are produced by fibroblasts of the organization itself, so the filling of wrinkles occurs gradually and lasts over time. There are of course some health conditions (eg haematological disorders) you should talk about with the doctor which might be contraindications for the implementation of the method.",
