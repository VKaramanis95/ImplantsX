Smile Designs made from these materials are tough, durable, and lifelike, even though they are just a thin layer. Over the past few years, there has been an increased demand for metal-free restorations. Patients have become more concerned about the presence of metal in their mouths and want to receive the most aesthetically pleasing restorations. This demand has been accommodated with the introduction of newer and stronger ceramics such as zirconia and e.max®, replacing older style feldspathic and leucite-based restorations. These materials offer superior strength and fit, combined with excellent aesthetics. Over the past decade, the companies providing metal-free ceramics have continually updated their products. The latest generation of materials provides improved opalescence, combined with lifelike shades and translucencies. All-ceramic restorations are healthier for gum tissues and provide long-lasting and reliable results. The lack of metal results in zero darkness around the gum margins, and light is transmitted through these materials in a way that closely replicates a natural tooth.",

We are proud to introduce our state-of-the-art digital scan service featuring the revolutionary ICam4D by Imetric4D, an advanced extraoral scanner designed specifically for multi-implant restorations. This technology enhances the precision and efficiency of implant placements by merging photogrammetry with structured light scanning techniques, ensuring the highest accuracy in 3D data capture. The ICam4D system enables swift and reliable measurements, crucial for creating flawless multi-implant restorations. The ICam4D digital scanning service at Happy Smile Clinic addresses common challenges in multi-unit implant procedures. By employing photogrammetric and structured light scanning methods, the ICam4D captures precise 3D data. The system uses specialized scan bodies called ICamBodies, equipped with 3D coding, to determine the exact positioning and orientation of implants. Our skilled implant specialists collaborate with our dental team to perform accurate extraoral scans, ensuring precise implant positioning without the discomfort of traditional impressions.

Patients benefit from a more comfortable experience as the ICam4D system eliminates the need for wide mouth openings typically required for traditional impressions. This technology also reduces chair time, material costs, and the need for try-in appointments, resulting in a near-perfect fit for final restorations and enhanced patient satisfaction. Implant dentistry is rapidly evolving, with All-on-4 & All-on-6 treatments becoming increasingly popular for fully edentulous patients. Ensuring a proper passive fit of the implant-supported prosthesis with technologies like ICam4D significantly improves the longevity and success of the implants. With Happy Smile Clinic and the ICam4D system, patients receive the most advanced, accurate, and comfortable implant treatment available today, reaffirming our commitment to excellence in dental care.",
   "allx_title3":"What distinguishes All-On-X?",
   "allx_page_p3":"While traditional dentures can be useful, they often lack stability and can be uncomfortable and awkward. The All-on-X implant system uses only four or six implants per arch to securely support a full set of teeth. Some implants are positioned at unique angles to enhance contact and maximize the existing bone’s natural support. Additionally, this method often reduces the need for bone grafting, which is sometimes required with conventional implant procedures.",
   "allx_title4":"How long does the procedure take ?",
   "allx_page_p4":"The duration of the procedure varies depending on the patient, but the surgery typically takes approximately two and a half hours per arch. With All-on-X, patients can receive their temporary teeth restoration immediately after surgery. However, there is a 4 to 6-month osseointegration period during which the implants fuse with the jawbone.",
   "allx_title5":"What is the success rate of All-On-X ?",
   "allx_page_p5":"All-on-X denture implants boast a high success rate, comparable to other implant procedures. They offer a cost-effective solution for patients seeking to restore missing teeth. The implants can be enhanced with 100% pure Zirconia Crowns over abutments to improve the aesthetics of the dental restoration. With proper care, All-on-X implants can last a lifetime. Patients can maintain their teeth as usual and should continue to visit the dentist for routine check-ups and cleanings.",
   "allx_title6":"What happens if I don't undergo the All-On-X procedure ?",
   "allx_page_p6":"When teeth are lost, progressive bone loss ensues. Without the stimulation provided by roots or implants, the bone rapidly resorbs, with up to 25% lost within the first year. While dentures and crowns may address cosmetic concerns, they fail to tackle bone loss in the jaw, leading to a weakened jawbone over time. This can result in a sunken facial appearance, which is highly unaesthetic. Dental implants stimulate the bone, preventing resorption and preserving facial aesthetics.",

   "blog_allx_all4orall6_p":"The key difference between All-on-4 and All-on-6 dental implants is the number of implants used. While not necessary for every patient, All-on-6 may be recommended for a more stable and durable foundation for the dental arch. The additional implants help distribute the pressure of chewing and biting more evenly, extending the lifespan of each arch and reducing the risk of further oral health issues. Moreover, these extra implants can enhance jawbone strength and stability, preventing future deterioration.",

From the strategic placement of the implants to the design of the oral appliance, this restoration facilitates convenient oral hygiene. All-on-X implants function much like natural teeth.

This disease occurs due to bacteria and infection in the gums and leads to inflammation and the bone and tissue supporting the teeth breaking down. Pregnancy, osteoporosis, and even some medications can also cause tooth loss. Many adults experience teeth loss, so you’re not alone. Dental implants offer the most incredible comfort of all tooth replacement solutions and avoid the long-term health effects of tooth loss and bone density reduction. Choosing to undergo a dental implant procedure is a big step, but one that can have a significant impact on the state of your health & quality of your life. Therefore, it’s so important that the procedure is performed with only the best tools, equipment, and materials. Losing teeth can occur for a wide range of different reasons. Perhaps the tooth was knocked out by an accidental impact or became so severely damaged as to necessitate an extraction, or maybe extensive tooth decay and other dental problems have caused one or more teeth to become loose or even fall out. Regardless of the underlying cause, lost teeth can lead to further oral health problems if left untreated. Fortunately, dental implants are a simple, effective, and permanent solution to the problem of lost and missing teeth. Dental implants are far superior to other options, such as traditional dentures or bridges. They can prevent many of the long-term dental problems known to develop because of the loss of teeth in the jaw, including gradual bone density loss and problems chewing or talking.",
    "blog_implants_gold_standard_p":"Dental implants are the only permanent tooth replacement option, and they’re designed to last for decades. Because they are surgically inserted into the jawbone, they provide health and functional benefits comparable to natural teeth. Since the implant itself mimics the form and structure of a natural tooth and is embedded directly into the jaw to take the place of the entire missing tooth and root, it prevents the loss of bone density.",
    "blog_implants_quality_implant_p":"The shape and structure of the post of the implant also have a significant impact on the connection between the bone and the replacement tooth. Many types of implants have specialised ‘threads’ on the post designed to provide the maximum surface area for the bone to adhere to, increasing the connection’s strength and the bond’s permanence. While there are many different manufacturers of dental implants, Happy Smile Clinic relies on the quality and advanced technology of the dental implants offered by Nobel BioCare, Straumann, and Hiossen. As the industry leader in dental implant innovation, both in design and material development, Nobel BioCare, Straumann, and Hiossen have a proven track record that is renowned worldwide. Happy Smile Clinics feels there is no better choice of dental implants for our patients than Nobel BioCare, Straumann, and Hiossen.",
    "blog_implants_eat_anything_p":"Yes. Once your implants have completely healed, you can treat them like natural teeth. Many patients report being able to eat foods that they couldn’t eat before surgery and can enjoy chewy and hard foods again. Only liquids and soft food are allowed during the healing process to prevent irritating your jaw and gums. This can range anywhere from a few days to a week before you can slowly add solid foods to your diet.",
    "blog_implants_additional_procedure_p":"Not always, but three different procedures can accompany implants. Bone grafting is needed if your jawbone is too thin or soft because chewing puts much pressure on your jawbone, and the implant can fail once you begin to eat solid food. A bone graft will strengthen your jawbone using a part of your bone from a different area of your body or synthetic bone material. A few months will be needed for the graft to grow strong enough to support the implant. A sinus augmentation is sometimes required if an implant is put in the upper jawbone, depending on the location of your sinuses. This procedure lifts the floor of the sinuses to give more room for the implant. Bone augmentation is needed if the patient’s jawbone needs additional work. Bone augmentation is a surgical procedure to replace bone surrounding the root of a tooth, making it possible for you to have an implant if you don’t have enough natural bone in your jaw. Unlike other body tissue types, bone can regenerate in the right conditions. A graft makes this process possible while helping to hold your implant and existing teeth in place. Over time, your bone will grow to replace the graft material. Once the site around the graft has successfully healed and been provided, you don’t need any other supporting treatments; you’ll be ready to have your implant placed. There are many reasons why you may not have enough bone to hold an implant securely in place, but you might need a bone graft if: -Your teeth are loose or unstable, or you suffer from gum disease. Gum disease can break down gum and bone tissue -You had a tooth extracted some time ago. The gap left following extraction can sometimes affect the teeth on either side, and the bone can begin to deteriorate -You’ve had lots of infections in your mouth. This can lead to bone loss over time -You’ve had an injury to your mouth. The impact could have led to bone loss.",
    "blog_implants_is_painful_p":"One of the biggest reasons people believe dental implant surgery is painful is what they see on the internet. A quick search for dental implant surgery will show you plenty of pictures of people getting holes in their gums, which looks pretty scary if you don’t know what’s happening. However, there is no need to worry as the procedure itself is not as painful as it looks. Let us use a scale of one to 10, with one representing minimal discomfort and 10 representing excruciating pain. A straightforward dental implant, for a patient with good bones and who does not need a lot of soft tissue surgery, has a pain level between two and three in the first 24 to 48 hours, which means over-the-counter medication like Tylenol or Advil will take care of any discomfort they are feeling. After the procedure, you will have difficulty eating regular food as your gums heal, so you will need to eat soft foods for a while. You must also avoid caffeine and tobacco products to prevent implant failure and other complications.",

First, select a simple toothbrush with medium and flexible heads. Your dentist can advise you on the right choice. Our toothbrush needs to be replaced every 3-4 months. If your toothbrush hardens earlier you brush very hard and this way you might injure oral tissues. Use a toothpaste containing fluoride to strengthen the tooth enamel.",

Regardless of the way you brush, the aim is to eliminate bacteria that accumulate at the junction of teeth with gums, with mild and gentle movements in order to avoid teeth abrasion and gingival recession. Brushing takes at least two minutes in order to clean all tooth surfaces, which is the surface that is visible in the mirror, the one we chew on, the one that rests on the tongue and the areas that exist interdentally.

In order to avoid sharing the same phobias from our childhood with our kids, it is important to “make acquaintance” with the oral hygiene and the dentist from an early age. Since its infancy, even before the appearance of the first teeth, we are supposed to clean the baby’s gums after eating with a special toothbrush. It is important is to announce this tusk with enthusiasm “Now you’re going to brush our teeth!!!” in order our child will finally embrace this good habit. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends that children should pay their first visit to the doctor at the age of one year’s old. The dentist should be specialized in dental treatment of children and adolescents, so that you can be sure that your child will feel comfortable and familiar with the clinic. In the first visit your child will be checked for traces of teeth caries. Although children’s first teeth will soon be replaced by the permanent ones, they must stay healthy until that time, in order to reserve a healthy space for the eruption of permanent teeth that grow underneath. At the age of 5-6 year’s old, the child’s dentition begins to get replaced, and that is when the dentist will determine the need for referral to an orthodontist to prevent future problems. Therefore do not neglect your child’s appointment with the dentist.",
